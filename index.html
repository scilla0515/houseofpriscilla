    <p class="mission-main">
      House of Priscilla Consulting was built on the belief that faith and excellence belong together. Inspired by the biblical partnership of Priscilla and Aquila, this firm stands as a modern reflection of that same wisdom, diligence, and grace.

    <div class="mission-sub">
      <p>
        We believe that every business has a divine assignment — a purpose that deserves structure, clarity, and care. Our mission is to help individuals and businesses steward their finances with integrity, confidence, and peace, bringing order where there’s overwhelm and vision where there’s uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through our accounting and consulting services, we blend strategy with spiritual grounding, offering guidance that not only strengthens your business but aligns it with God’s purpose for your life. This is more than consulting — it’s the pursuit of excellence that honors Him.

      <p class="about-main">
        Priscilla Boateng, founder of House of Priscilla Consulting, is passionate about merging faith with financial excellence. With a background in accounting and information systems, she believes that stewardship — both spiritual and financial — is key to building something that lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guided by her faith and inspired by the biblical Priscilla’s example of wisdom and partnership, she created this firm as a space for purpose-driven professionals to receive clarity, confidence, and support in their financial journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her approach is rooted in service, integrity, and prayer — helping others operate in excellence while trusting God with the increase. With a side of passion for creativity and a background in coding, she also brings a unique touch to the digital side of business — creating websites from scratch, just like this one.
